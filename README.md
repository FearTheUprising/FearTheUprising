Hello, my name is Harrison. I am a learning developer; I am practicing in coding in C. 
Most of my projects are small. But, I pride myself on working on bigger ones. 

My interests:
🖥️ I love computers and learning to code. 
▶️ I love watching YouTube and movies.
🐈‍⬛ I love my cat and playing with him.
🚶 I also love to spend time walking and running during the day. 

My goals are to become a Cybersecurity specalist and an ethical hacker. I want to learn a variety of languages and create programs with them.
